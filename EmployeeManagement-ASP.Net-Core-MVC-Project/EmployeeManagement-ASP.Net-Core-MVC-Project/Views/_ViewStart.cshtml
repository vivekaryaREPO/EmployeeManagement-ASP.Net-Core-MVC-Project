@*Instead of specifying the below code in every view i.e razor code block, we may make use of
    _ViewStart.cshtml
    -code in _ViewStart.cshtml is executed before the code in individual view.
    -move common code like Layout property to the _ViewStart.cshtml.
    -ViewStart reduces code redundancy and improves maintainability.
    -You can change your _layout.cshtm anytime, and you will not have to update it in every view
     to do so. So this saves time and chances of errors decrease.
     -you can have multiple viewstart file, and they are hierarchical i.e, if you place them in
    any sub-folder of Views eg. Home folder, then Home folder viewstart file will override
    the viewstart file in Views folder.
    -You can explicitly use diffrent layout for a view by giveing value to the Layout property.
    -You can dynamically select the layout file.
        eg.
            @{
                if(User.IsInRole("Admin"))
                {
                    Layout = "_AdminLayout";
                }
                else
                {
                Layout = "_NonAdminLayout";
                }
            }

    @{
        Layout = "~/Views/Shared/_Layout.cshtml";

    }*@



@{
    Layout = "_Layout";
}
